Implement a program that determines the winner of a short Scrabble-like game. 
Program should prompt for input twice: once for “Player 1” to input their word and once for “Player 2” to input their word. 
Then, depending on which player scores the most points, 
Program should either print “Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!” (in the event the two players score equal points).
